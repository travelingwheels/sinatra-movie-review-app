Specs:
- [x] Use Sinatra to build the app
- [x] Use ActiveRecord for storing information in a database
- [x] Include more than one model class (e.g. User, Post, Category)
      Two classes review and user
- [x] Include at least one has_many relationship on your User model (e.g. User has_many Posts)
      A user has many reviews
- [x] Include at least one belongs_to relationship on another model (e.g. Post belongs_to User)
      A review belongs to a user
- [x] Include user accounts with unique login attribute (username or email)
      Can login with an email and password
- [x] Ensure that the belongs_to resource has routes for Creating, Reading, Updating and Destroying
      Reviews can be created, read, updated, and deleted(destroyed)

Confirm
- [x] You have a large number of small Git commits
- [x] Your commit messages are meaningful
- [x] You made the changes in a commit that relate to the commit message
- [x] You don't include changes in a commit that aren't related to the commit message
      Overall I did better with commit messages on this project then on the CLI project, but I know I need more practice.
